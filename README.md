# python-project-news-summarizer

PROJECT: news.automate

OVERVIEW
The following program of codes, first ask the user for either a News URL or an Image Filename.
After receiving either of the two, the program would then extract the text from each sources and
eventually run those contents through a summarizer algorithm. By doing so, the user is able to quickly
summarize a piece of article either from online sources or from a camera image they took, put it into
the folders they want, thus allowing the user to save more time while getting the content they needed from 
the news. 

GOALS: To automate daily reading news behavior.

1.  Create a text summarizer
2. Create a program that extracts text from an image
3.  Create a text classifier
